# STM32F103C8

This project about of functions of `STM32F103C8` and more.

## Overview Introduction about `STM32F103C8`

- `STM32F103C8T6` is a 32 bit microcontroller, belonging to the F1 family of the ST series `STM32` chip.

- ARM CORTEX M3 core.

- Maximum speed 72Mhz.

- Memory: 64 kbytes Flash memory, 20 kbytes SRAM.

- Clock, reset and power management:

  + Operating voltage from 2.0 → 3.6V.

  + Use external quartz from 4Mhz → 20Mhz.

  + Internal quartz uses RC oscillator in 8Mhz or 40Khz mode.

- Low voltage mode:

  + There are modes: sleep, inactive or active in standby mode.

  + Power the Vbat pin with an external battery to use the RTC and use the stored data when the mains power is lost.
  
- 2 sets of 12-bit ADCs with 9 channels each:

  + Conversion value range from 0 – 3.6 V.

  + Single-channel or multi-channel sampling mode is available.

- DMA:

  + 7 channels DMA.

  + There is DMA support for ADC, UART, I2C, SPI.

- 7 sets of Timers:

  + 3 16-bit Timer supports Input Capture/ Output Compare/ PWM modes.

  + 1 16-bit Timer support to control the motor with Input interrupt, dead-time protection modes.

  + 2 Watchdog Timer for protection and error checking.

  + 1 Systick Timer 24 bit count down for Delay function,…

- Supports 9 communication channels:

  + 2 sets of I2C.

  + 3 sets of USART.

  + 2 SPI.

  + 1 CAN.

  + USB 2.0 full-speed interface.

- Check for CRC and 96-bit ID errors.
